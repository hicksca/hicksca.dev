Changing things in my home lab 
Moving things off some hold hardware to different VCS platform.

Currently stubbing out the repo. 

This I want in the new setup:

git worktrees
nix-shell (to setup the dev env and manage dependancies)
Site Gen script 
(Was using emacs setup that I had but have moved to neovim
 site was more a single landing page ... will end up setup 
 a blog maybe not fully this first pass but will get there)


more stuff to come as I think about it ...
